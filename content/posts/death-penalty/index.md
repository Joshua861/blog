Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a highly contentious issue that raises several moral, ethical, and practical concerns. At its core, it involves the state taking the life of a person as punishment for a crime they have been convicted of.

## Against the death penalty

[There are numerous compelling arguments against using the death penalty](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/issues/death-penalty) as a form of punishment. One of the most fundamental of these is the belief that killing another human being is fundamentally immoral. This belief is based on the idea that [all individuals have an inherent right to life and that the state should not have the authority to take away that right.](file:///D:/Josh's%20stuff/JoshHub/punishment.htm#rights)  
  
Another major objection to the death penalty is that it is inherently flawed and can result in the execution of innocent people. This is a tragic and unacceptable result, as there is no way to reverse it once an execution has occurred. The death penalty is often more costly than life imprisonment due to the extra legal steps taken to prevent executing innocent people.  
  
[Critics further say that the death penalty is ineffective in deterring crime](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13363/deterrence-and-the-death-penalty) and that the resources necessary to administer it may be better spent on improving other aspects of the criminal justice system. The existing methods of execution in the United States, such as lethal injection and electrocution, have been widely condemned as cruel and barbaric. Furthermore, the protracted periods of time that offenders spend on death row might also be regarded as overly cruel and brutal.  
  
Moreover, [one study](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/DonohueCTStudy.pdf) showed that the death penalty disproportionately affects minority groups and the poor, who are more likely to be sentenced to death than those who are wealthier or from a different race. This raises significant concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the criminal justice system. Many argue that alternative forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, are more humane and effective, as they still provide a form of punishment while also allowing for the possibility of rehabilitation.  
  
A [study](https://files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/documents/WashingtonCosts.pdf) found defense costs were about three times as high in death-penalty cases and prosecution costs were as much as four times higher than for non-death penalty cases.  
  
Nations that carry out the most executions are frequently those whose judicial systems are under scrutiny for issues of fairness and impartiality. The three nations with the highest number of executions in 2012 – China, Iran, and Iraq – have all been criticized for imposing death sentences in a manner that lacks transparency.

[Another study](file:///D:/Josh's%20stuff/homework/RE/www.files.deathpenaltyinfo.org/legacy/files/pdf/OregonDeathPenaltyCostAnalysis.pdf) found that the death penalty may be more expensive to use. Death sentences cost Oregon taxpayers an average of $2.3 million, including jail costs. When state jail costs are excluded, the discrepancy is even more pronounced. The analysis also discovered that the expense of the death sentence increased over time, from $274,209 in the 1980s to $1,783,148 in the 2000s.  
  
[One of the leading justifications for the use of the death penalty is that it deters crime. This claim has been repeatedly tested by researchers. The majority of research from both the US and worldwide has found no evidence of a deterrence effect.](https://humanrights.brightblue.org.uk/blog-1/2016/4/22/does-the-death-penalty-deter-crime#:~:text=one%20of%20the%20leading%20justifications%20for%20the%20use%20of%20the%20death%20penalty%20is%20that%20it%20deters%20crime.%20this%20claim%20has%20been%20repeatedly%20tested%20by%20researchers.%20the%20majority%20of%20research%20from%20both%20the%20us%20and%20worldwide%20has%20found%20no%20evidence%20of%20a%20deterrence%20effect.)

Another argument against the death penalty is that reformed prisoners have the potential to do a lot of good for the world. This is exemplified by the story of people like Nicky Cruz, who was found guilty of murder but went on to become a Christian evangelist and improved the lives of many young people. He's not the only one, many other examples like Stanley "Tookie" Williams, co-founder of the Crips street gang, who became an anti-gang activist and children's author while serving a life sentence. Or, like John Newton, a former slave trader who wrote the famous hymn "Amazing Grace" after turning to Christianity and dedicating the rest of his life to abolitionist causes.

These stories serve as a powerful examples of how even those who have committed heinous crimes can turn their lives around and make a positive impact on society. Reformed prisoners can serve as powerful advocates for change, not only within the criminal justice system but also in their communities. They have a unique perspective on the issues of crime and punishment, and can provide valuable insight into the causes of criminal behavior and potential solutions. They also serve as role models for other offenders, showing that change is possible and that a life of crime is not a predetermined fate.  
  
Furthermore, reformed prisoners can also contribute to society by participating in programs such as restorative justice, where they can take responsibility for their actions and make amends to their victims and the community. This not only helps the offender to take responsibility for their actions but also allows the victims and the community to find closure and move forward.

## For the death penalty

The argument that "the punishment should fit the crime" is often put forth as a justification for the use of the death penalty, particularly in cases of heinous crimes such as murder. Proponents of this viewpoint argue that when someone takes the life of another person, they forfeit their own right to life. Therefore, they should be subject to capital punishment.  

{{< figure src="/images/crime.jpeg" alt="Alt text" >}}

Another argument for the death penalty is that it serves as a form of just punishment for serious crimes and provides a sense of closure for the victims' families. It's also believed that executing a murderer may deter others from committing similar crimes in the future. Additionally, by permanently removing dangerous criminals from society, the death penalty is seen as a way to protect the public from future harm.  
  
Furthermore, supporters of the death penalty argue that the benefits to society of deterring and removing killers outweigh the minimal chance of making the wrong decision. They also argue that the death penalty is cost-effective when compared to life imprisonment. They believe that, when all the costs of an appeal are taken into account, it would be less expensive to carry out the death penalty.  
  
Critics of the death penalty argue that it is inhumane, fallible, and does not effectively deter crime. There are legitimate concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the criminal justice system. The death penalty disproportionately affects minority groups and the poor, which raises significant concerns about its application.  

## Christian views on the death penalty

Christian views on the death penalty are varied and complex. Different denominations and individuals hold different beliefs.  
  
Some Christians believe that the death penalty is morally justifiable and that it serves as a form of retribution for heinous crimes such as murder. They may cite Old Testament passages, such as "an eye for an eye," as justification for the death penalty. Another example is that in Genesis 9:6 it says, "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image."  
  
However, other Christians argue that the death penalty is not in line with the teachings of Jesus and the overall message of love and redemption in the New Testament. They may point to Jesus' teachings on forgiveness and non-violence as a reason to oppose the death penalty.  
  
The Catholic Church has historically supported the use of the death penalty in certain cases, such as in self-defence or in cases of "grave and prolonged danger to the safety of the people." However, in recent years, the Church has shifted its position and now calls for the abolition of the death penalty, stating that "the dignity of the human person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes."  
  
Many protestant denominations have taken a similar stance and have spoken out against the death penalty as well.  
  
It's worth noting that while some religious individuals and groups may have specific views on the death penalty, the issue is highly complex and nuanced, and there are valid arguments on both sides. Some religious figures and leaders have spoken out against the death penalty and advocated for alternatives to the death penalty, such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  

## Jewish views on the death penalty

Traditionally, Jewish law has recognised the authority of the secular government to impose the death penalty, and it has been used as punishment for certain crimes such as murder, idolatry, and certain sexual offences. The Talmud, which is a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, contains a number of passages discussing the use of the death penalty. Jewish law traditionally sets out a number of strict requirements that must be met in order for a death sentence to be carried out.  
  
However, in recent years, many Jewish scholars and leaders have spoken out against the death penalty, arguing that it is no longer morally justifiable in modern society. Some have pointed to the high risk of error and the possibility of executing an innocent person, as well as the idea that the death penalty is not a deterrent to crime.  
  
Additionally, many Jews believe in the value of rehabilitation and redemption, and some argue that the death penalty does not leave room for either the offender or the victim's family to find forgiveness and healing. They also point out the Jewish tradition of repentance, Tikkun Olam, and the principle of preserving human life, Pikuach Nefesh, as reasons to abolish the death penalty.  
  
As with other religious groups, it's worth noting that Jewish views on the death penalty are diverse and nuanced, and there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Some Jewish organizations and leaders have advocated for alternatives to the death penalty, such as life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  

## My views and conclusion

In summary, a life sentence in prison is a more morally and financially sound option than the death penalty. It allows for the possibility of exoneration in the event of wrongful conviction, and also offers opportunities for rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Furthermore, the death penalty raises ethical concerns regarding the state's authority to take lives, and the methods used in execution can be deemed inhumane. In contrast, a life sentence does not have the same moral implications.
