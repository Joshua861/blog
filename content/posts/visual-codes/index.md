Visual codes are elements we see in a media product. They relate to the images in media products, but also to elements like the background, logos, or graphics. It is important to consider all aspects of the misen-scene[^fn:1] when analysing a media product.

Some examples of visual codes are:

-   Props
-   Dress codes
-   Location
-   Color
-   Gestures (body language/facial expressions)

    Uses a lot of red and gold which are ofter associated with royalty, making the sweets seem posh.
-   There are guesture codes like the two women kissing the man, presumably because they are **so happy** that they got them some **amazing** chocolates, making the viewer think that if they get these chocolates they'll be popular or something.
