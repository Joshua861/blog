-   Semiotics is the study of signs and meaning.
-   Explores how people derive meaning from the world around them.
-   A sign is anything that symbolises or represents something else.
    (e.g a buzzing sound may mean there is a bee nearby)


## Catagories of sign {#catagories-of-sign}

-   Icon
    Directly resembles the object, shares tangible qualities.
    (e.g a picture of a banana is an icon for it, or clapping some coconuts together is an icon for the sound of horses hooves)
-   Index
    Has an implied association, they're connected in a logical way.
    (e.g the smell of smoke indicates a fire)
-   Symbol
    Not inherently connected, but is a matter of convention within a culture. Symbols have to be taught and so are more likely to be misunderstood.
    (e.g dotted lines on a road, the pound sign, most words)


## Constructed meanings {#constructed-meanings}

-   Barthes argues that constructed meanings (symbols) can come to seem self-evident throught the process of naturalisation.
-   Connotations are often linked to culture, for example, the color red in western cultures denotes love or danger, but in eastern cultures it is associated with luck, long life, and happiness.
-   If red was used in a media product, people from different cultures might get a different impression.
