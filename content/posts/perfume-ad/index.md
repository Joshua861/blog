I went with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE) Old Spice ad.


## Technical codes {#technical-codes}


### Shots and Angles {#shots-and-angles}

-   The entire commercial is shot at eye level.
-   It goes between medium-closeup, medium and wide at the end.


## Visual codes {#visual-codes}


### Dress {#dress}

-   The speaker is shirtless the whole time, and is _obviously_ being sexualised.


### Location and color {#location-and-color}

-   The first location is a boring, room with lots of desaturaed, warm colors, and fairly poor lighting (your life before Old Spice).
-   The second (which I guess takes place immediately after you put on Old Spice), you are in a brightly, naturally lit outdoor area, with cooler colors.
-   This emphasises the contrast before before you buy, and after.


### Gestures {#gestures}

-   The speaker is staring directly at you the whole way through.
-   It makes you feel like they're talking to you specifically.
-   They also ask you to do a couple little, almost effortless things, that if you do, will (maybe idk this isn't psychology) make you more likely to do the most important thing they ask you, to buy the product.
-   The fact that they never pause talking or looking at you keeps your eyes glued to the screen.


## Misc {#misc}


### Target audience {#target-audience}

-   Despite directly calling the viewer a 'lady', it also tries to appeal to the stereotype for a _masculine_ man should be.
    -   With the words 'Smell like a man, man', and 'if he stopped smelling like a lady', it might play into their insecurities that they wont be a real man unless they buy this product.


### Memorability {#memorability}

The weird style, quite funny joke and catchy jingle to finish it off, all make this quite a memorable ad.
