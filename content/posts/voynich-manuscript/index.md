Written on vellum, the Voynich Manuscript dates back to the early 15th century, with carbon dating placing it between 1404 and 1438. The script used in the manuscript, known as 'Voynichese,' remains an enigma, as it has yet to be linked to any known language or writing system. Stylistic analysis suggests that it may have originated during the Italian Renaissance.

This captivating manuscript owes its name to Wilfrid Voynich, a book dealer who acquired it in 1912. Since then, it has found a home at Yale University's prestigious Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Despite the diligent efforts of professional and amateur cryptographers, including codebreakers from World War I and II, the Voynich Manuscript has successfully resisted all attempts at decryption.

Countless theories and hypotheses have emerged over the years, each attempting to unravel the secrets hidden within the manuscript's pages. Some propose that it encodes a lost or constructed language, while others consider it nothing more than an elaborate hoax.

The entire manuscript was published online in Yale's digital collections library, letting people try to decipher it themselves.

## Part 1 â€“ The Book

The manuscript is about 24 by 16 by 5 centimetres. The number of pages is around 240 but depends on if the book's unusual fold-outs are opened.

Protein testing in 2014 revealed that the parchment was made from calf skin, but was prepared with so much care that the skin side is largely indistinguishable from the flesh side.

### The text

Most of the text is in an unidentified language, running left to right, and without any obvious punctuation.

The text consists of over 170 thousand characters, with about 35 thousand words. At least 28 folios (pages) are missing from the manuscript.

### Illustrations

The illustrations in the book are the main way people try to figure out what's being said, since we are unable to understand the text. There are six sections with different drawing styles and subjects.

The sections are:

- Herbal,
- Astronomical,
- Balneological, the science of the therapeutic use of baths,
- Cosmological
- Pharmaceutical,
- and Recipes

It's believed that the manuscript was meant as a pharmacopoeia, or a book for use to identify medicines, however that wouldn't explain the astronomical and cosmological sections. As well as this, only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, so it may not have been much use with that.

## History

Researchers radiocarbon dated the manuscript's vellum to between 1404 and 1438. The text and illustrations are all characteristically European, and the paints used were made of materials common at that time, in Europe.

The manuscript was owned by many people before being donated to the Yale Library in 1969.

## Language Theories

Over the years, many theories have been developed about the language in the manuscript.

### Ciphers

One is that it was written in an existing language, that was mapped onto the Voynich alphabet, through a cipher. An algorithm to stop the text from being read.

Unfortunately, almost all ciphers from that time fail to match the text in the manuscript.

### Natural Language

Another theory is that it is written in a natural language, that we can't understand. There has been lots of research into this. Comparisons have been made to Chinese and Vietnamese, as morphemes generally only have one syllable, or a North Germanic dialect, due to the skeletal syntax.

### Hoax

Another popular theory is that the manuscript contains nothing of meaning, that it was just a hoax or joke. However, many people have claimed that the text is too sophisticated to be a hoax. Marcelo Montemurro published findings that there are many language like features that were unlikely to be added into text to make it more realistic. But others argue that these patterns could also appear in hoaxed texts, using the grille method, or self citation.

## Decipherment claims

Over the years, many people have claimed to have deciphered the text, but none of these efforts have been successful so far.
